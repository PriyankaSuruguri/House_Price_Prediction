# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on several key attributes. The dataset includes various features that influence house prices, such as average income in the area, house age, number of rooms, and other relevant factors.
## Overview
This project explores the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices. By analyzing key features such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, and population, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions. The implementation demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, evaluating, and deploying a predictive model.

## Abstract
The housing market is a critical component of the global economy, and predicting house prices accurately has numerous applications, from real estate to financial planning. This project leverages Linear Regression, a straightforward yet powerful predictive modeling technique, to analyze how various factors influence house prices. The study includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation, offering insights into the relationships between features and the target variable.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze the relationship between house prices and various influencing factors.
- To build a Linear Regression model for accurate house price predictions.
- To evaluate the model’s performance using standard metrics.
- To provide a reproducible framework for similar predictive modeling tasks.

## Methodology
Steps:
- Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Standardize/normalize numeric features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the distribution of features using distplot.
Analyze pairwise relationships between features using pairplot.
Examine correlations using a heatmap.
- Model Building:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Linear Regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Visualize predictions versus actual values using scatter plots.
- Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

## Results
Key performance metrics for the model include:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- R-squared (R²): Explains the proportion of variance in the target variable captured by the model.
The results indicate that the model provides reasonable predictions, with strong correlations observed between input features and house prices. Visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and distplots reveal clear patterns that validate the model's assumptions.

# Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of Linear Regression in predicting house prices based on key features. While the model performs well, further improvements could include incorporating additional features, handling potential outliers, or experimenting with more complex algorithms. The insights derived from this analysis can guide real estate professionals and policy-makers in making informed decisions.
